Make sure your virtual environment is activated. From the provided prompt (venv) PS C:\Users\timur\WebstormProjects\back-mock>, it seems that your virtual environment is already active. If not, activate it using:

On Windows:
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the 'djangorestframework' package within your virtual environment:

Copy code
pip install djangorestframework
After installing 'djangorestframework', run the database migration again:

Copy code
python manage.py migrate
If you encounter any other missing module errors during the migration or when running the server, make sure to install the required packages using pip.

Finally, start the development server:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
With these steps, the 'rest_framework' module should be available in your virtual environment, and the migration and server should run without any issues. You can now access your Django app in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
